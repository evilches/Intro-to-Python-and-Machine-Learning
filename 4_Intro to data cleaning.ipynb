Up until now, we have been introducing ideas and techniques in order to prepare you with a toolbox of techniques to deal with real-world situations. We are now going to start using some of those tools while also giving you some ideas about how and when to use them in your own work with data.\n\nReal-world data is messy. You will likely need to combine several data sources to get the data you actually want. The data from those sources will be incomplete. And it will likely not be formatted in exactly the way you want in order to perform your analysis. It's for these reasons that most data scientists will tell you that about 80 percent of any project is spent just getting the data into a form ready for analysis.\n\n## Exploring `DataFrame` information\n\n> **Learning goal:** By the end of this subsection, you should be comfortable finding general information about the data stored in pandas DataFrames.\n\nOnce you have loaded your data into pandas, it will more likely than not be in a `DataFrame`. However, if the data set in your `DataFrame` has 60,000 rows and 400 columns, how do you even begin to get a sense of what you're working with? Fortunately, pandas provides some conventient tools to quickly look at overall information about a `DataFrame` in addition to the first few and last few rows.\n\nIn order to explore this functionality, we will import the Python scikit-learn library and use an iconic dataset that every data scientist has seen hundreds of times: British biologist Ronald Fisher's *Iris* data set used in his 1936 paper \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\":"

How missing data is handled carries with it subtle tradeoffs that can affect your final analysis and real-world outcomes.\n\nPandas handles missing values in two ways. The first you've seen before in previous sections: `NaN`, or Not a Number. This is a actually a special value that is part of the IEEE floating-point specification and it is only used to indicate missing floating-point values.\n\nFor missing values apart from floats, pandas uses the Python `None` object. While it might seem confusing that you will encounter two different kinds of values that say essentially the same thing, there are sound programmatic reasons for this design choice and, in practice, going this route enables pandas to deliver a good compromise for the vast majority of cases. Notwithstanding this, both `None` and `NaN` carry restrictions that you need to be mindful of with regards to how they can be used."

This is what gives them their tremendous power for large-scale data and computational work, but it also limits their flexibility. Such arrays have to upcast to the “lowest common denominator,” the data type that will encompass everything in the array.

While you would probably not notice this performance hit, for large datasets it might become an issue.\n\nThe second side effect stems from the first.
